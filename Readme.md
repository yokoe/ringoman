Ringoman is a gui frontend app for appledoc.

I was impressed by appledoc, the documentation generator. Documents generated by appledoc are really cool, but there are some inconveniences with its usage, so I decided to create a GUI frontend for it.

Ringo is a Japanese word for 'Apple'. And I am a fan of both Apple and The Beatles.
